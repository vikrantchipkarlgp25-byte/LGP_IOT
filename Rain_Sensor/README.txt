This project uses a Wemos Mini microcontroller connected to a rain sensor and an LED to show real-time rain detection and control the LED from a dashboard on iot.roboninja.in. The rain sensor detects water and sends a signal to the Wemos, which reads this signal and updates two values on the cloud: one for the rain status and one for the LED state. The dashboard fetches these values every few seconds and shows the rain status as YES or NO and the LED state as ON or OFF. On the dashboard, there are buttons to turn the LED ON, OFF, or set it to automatic mode, where the LED turns on or off depending on whether it is raining. The Serial Monitor on the Wemos also prints the rain detection, the LED command received from the cloud, and the LED’s current state, so it is easy to see what is happening and check if everything is working correctly.

The project works well, but there are a few small issues. The LED may take a few seconds to respond after pressing the dashboard buttons because the Wemos only checks the cloud values at set intervals. The rain sensor cannot be put fully into water and only detects water on its surface, so it might not always trigger if the water coverage is not enough. Also, the system needs a stable Wi-Fi connection, otherwise the Wemos cannot send or receive data from the cloud. Even with these small limits, the project successfully shows real-time rain detection, updates the dashboard, and allows both manual and automatic control of the LED. It is a complete interactive IoT project that works well for learning and demonstrating how sensors and cloud dashboards can be used together.
